  "date": "2026-02-25",
  "description": "Upgraded Node.js runtime to 24 LTS across netlify.toml, root package.json, and netlify/functions/package.json. Added @types/node@^24.0.0 to devDependencies. Integrated ServerStatus indicator into Footer.tsx (pings /.netlify/functions/health on load; green dot with animate-ping when operational, red when issues). Fixed custom 404: added [[redirects]] catch-all in netlify.toml routing all unmatched paths to index.html so React's getPageFromUrl() handles unknown routes and renders the custom NotFound/PandaGame page.",
