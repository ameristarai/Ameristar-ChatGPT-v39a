# ── SPA Catch-all Redirect ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Netlify serves files from /dist directly. Any path that doesn't match a real
# file (e.g. /bogus-url) would return Netlify's default 404 without this rule.
# status = 200 means "serve index.html but keep the original URL in the browser"
# — React's getPageFromUrl() then reads the URL and renders the custom NotFound page.
