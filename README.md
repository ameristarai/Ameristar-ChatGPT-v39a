Picking up from Versions 36, you have now used Gemini to suggest how to integrate the health.js into a Status Light. Also, updated Node.js to the LTS stable version 24.x. Instructed Netlify to redirected Error 404s (game) to your custom "Notfound.tsx" file. NPM was also updated to 11.10.1 from 11.8.0.

Upon testing the original v39, you discovered that the Enrollment page submit for broke, once again. Gemini suggesteed a simple fix: Open the root folder's "packages.json". Add "nodemailer": "^8.0.1", back into the "dependencies" section. Then, delete the "packages.json" and "packages-lock.json" files from the "\netlify\functions\" folder. I suspected due to the updates to some of the tools above, the best practice is to, once again, have all the tools listed and called from the main "packages.json" file in the root, instead of the subfolders. I guess Netlify doesn't need to do this separately in its function folder.
